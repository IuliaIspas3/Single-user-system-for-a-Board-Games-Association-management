The project simulates a borrowing and lending system with several features, including the ability to add, edit, and remove board games. Java and JavaFX for UI are the technologies applied in the project's development. XML files have been used for storing information about the games, loans, and reservations. The application is a group project, built using the Waterfall Methodology.
